# Teoriundervisning.dk

<div className="content">

Teoriundervisning is one of the most successfull driving test theory systems in Denmark
I worked for Teoriundervisning in the period Nov. 2020 - Aug. 2023 in this time we rebuilt the whole system.

When we started to rebuild Teoriundervisning.dk we had to choose some tools to build the system with.
As some from the team had experience in MySQL and .NET the choice fell on that. I myself had experience with React.js and therefore we choose that.

So in the end the following tools we used was: 
- ReactTS
- GraphQL
- ASP.NET
- MySQL

To better explain and structure this explanation i will divide the project in *Frontend* and *Backend* as this was how the project was divided in our workflow

## Frontend
The frontend consists of a ReactTS project.
This means that the project is written in *React.js* with the *Typescript* language. I used *SCSS* for styling the project as we used many custom components.

Some notable features i made in the project was:
- *Advanced Login Flow with 3 different ways to register*
- *Quiz simulator that displays videos, images and reads questions aloud*
- *Complete CMS for the Quiz*
- *Complete Student experience, with tracked content and progress*

These are just a few noted features about the whole system as it is quite big and it would be impossible to explain everything in detail.
As it is with these huge kind of projects, we were not 100% done with it when i left it. There is always something new to implement and finish up.
But i left it at a very functional state where it was used by production users

## Backend
The backend became a bit too complicated according to my opionion.
What was made was for too big and didn't need all the steps that it has today.

The backend consists of:
- *GraphQL API for endpoints to frontend*
- *.NET Application for connection between API and Database*
- *MySQL database where all the logical operations are inside*

When you place all the logical operations inside the Database via Stored Procedures, there simply is no need for a .NET application to sanitize the inputs.
With the new technology today you can still sanitize your inputs via Javascript in the API and Stored Procedures only allow the defined types you are putting into them.
This is why when i became a Fullstack Developer it took a very long time to develop new features as a new feature from the backend to the frontend would pass through 4 different layers.

# Conclusion
When i was done with project i was relieved, but also grateful for all the things i learned while i developed this project.
We had a strong team culture and a belief that anything could be built!
Teoriundervisning.dk will live on without me and be a very successful product in the capable hands of its owners.
Thanks for everything!
