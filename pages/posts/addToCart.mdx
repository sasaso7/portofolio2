This project was born out of my personal curiosity to delve into basic JavaScript. Leveraging my prior exposure to Firebase during my final school project, I had already established a fundamental grasp of the platform.

The core concept of the project was to create a collaborative shopping list that encompassed the following features:

- <p>Robust login system</p>
- <p>Comprehensive CRUD functionality for managing items in the shopping list</p>
- <p>Mechanism for linking users together to share the same list</p>


Even with these initial specifications, the project presented a considerable set of features to implement.

Undertaking this venture without the support of a framework, relying solely on basic JavaScript, represented a noteworthy challenge. It marked my inaugural foray into constructing an entire project in this manner, demanding meticulous attention to several critical facets:

- Upholding Code Clarity: Ensuring the codebase maintained a clear and organized structure proved to be a significant undertaking.

- Managing Package Imports: Handling package imports was a pivotal aspect that necessitated a methodical approach.

- Establishing Project Structure: Creating a coherent project structure emerged as an essential task, one often streamlined by frameworks like Next.js or React.js.

Frameworks, with their predefined structures and streamlined package handling, serve as invaluable aids. Consequently, when working without such frameworks, mastery of these aspects becomes imperative.

Firebase played a pivotal role as the backend for this project, and I can only commend its capabilities. Typically, embarking on a project entails addressing concerns regarding security, user verification, implementing a robust login system, and setting up a database. Firebase, however, provides all these components, streamlining the process. The only prerequisite is proficiency in integrating it within a frontend application.

It's worth noting that this project serves solely as a prototype of an idea and was never intended for use by anyone other than myself and my significant other.
