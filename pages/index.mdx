# Philip Meisner Pedersen

Hey, I'm a Software Developer.

I began my career in development by pursuing an AP Degree in Computer Science. While I was still studying, I came across an opportunity at Teoriundervisning.dk, where they needed assistance as a Customer Experience Tester.

Soon, it became evident that my skills were better suited for more advanced development work, and I transitioned into a role as a Frontend Developer for the company. We undertook a complete site overhaul, bidding farewell to our other developers. Subsequently, I assumed a Fullstack Role, where I was responsible for maintaining and expanding the system. This is why I have gained a broad range of experience in developing with various tools.
